"# discord-mass-deletion-bot" 

Small simple personal project I created to solve a problem I had when using discord.

This bots purpose allows the users in a discord server to select messages up to 25 lines sent through a server and delete the select ammount from the current posted messages. Since discord does not allow users even with admin power to delete bulk messages, I created this so solve the issue.
